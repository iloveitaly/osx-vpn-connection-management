Mac VPN Connection Management
=============================

**NOTE: this is some old code that I haven't touched in a couple years, and may have not worked completely when I originally wrote it. That being said, there is no API for managing VPN connection in OS X. This is a good starting point for anyone who needs to manage VPN connections programmatically.**


ObjC Library for Creating/Editing/Deleting VPN Connections. Simple objc API that interfaces with some GUI scripting.

GUI scripting has become harder with Mavericks. Check out [this script](https://gist.github.com/iloveitaly/2ff08138091afd69cf2b) for an easy way to enable GUI scripting.

This is great for automatically updating a VPN connection information on a bunch of machines that you manage.
